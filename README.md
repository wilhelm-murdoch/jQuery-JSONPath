# jQuery JSONPath

This plugin allows you to query JSON objects with XPath-esque expressions using jQuery. I did not come up with the actual querying / traversal logic as that was already written by the entrepid Stefan Goessner. This library in its original form would have been enough for me if I didn't need to intercept matching nodes as they were found. I thought combining this with jQuery was the perfect solution for what I needed.

## Requirements

1. jQuery (tested on 1.6.4, 1.7.2, 1.8.2 and up)
2. Yeah... that's about it

## Configuration

As this is the initial version that covers my basic requirements, there are only a handful configuration options.

### data

* Type: JSON Object
* Default: `{}`

This represents the JSON object you want to query.

### resultType

* Type: String
* Options: `VALUE | PATH |  BOTH`
* Default: `VALUE`

Determines the type of information to respond with. If `VALUE` is selected, it returns the matching value of the associated expression. `PATH` will return the direct path to the matching node. Choosing 'BOTH' will, obviously, return both 'PATH' and associated 'VALUE', but will also change the structure of the returned items into the following:

    [{
      path: '$.path.goes[0]here',
      value: 'OMGHAI'
    }]

### keepHistory

* Type: Boolean
* Options: `true | false`
* Default: `true`

By default, every subsequent result will include all previous query result sets. Setting this option to `false` will clear the result history and only return the latest result.

## Events

### onFound(path, value)

* `path` The JSONPath expression leading to this node
* `value` The value of the matching node

Called when a matching node has been found.

### onNormalize(expression)

* `expression` The full JSONPath expression specified when invoking `query()`

Called when JSONPath validates the specified expression.

### onTrace(expression, value, path)

* `expression` The full JSONPath expression specified when invoking `query()`
* `value` The value of the current node
* `path` The path to the current node

Called every time JSONPath crawls through the dataset.

_note: `trace` is invoked recursively, so be careful about what you put in here. Performance will be affected on larger datasets._

### onWalk(loc, expression, value, path, func)

* `loc` The current "bit" of the normalized JSONPath expression.
* `expression` The full JSONPath expression specified when invoking `query()`
* `value` The value of the current node
* `path` The path to the current node
* `func` Function to apply to the current node

Called every time JSONPath crawls through the dataset.

_note: `walk` is invoked recursively, so be careful about what you put in here. Performance will be affected on larger datasets._

## Methods

### $.JSONPath(options).options(updated_options)

* `updated_options` A JSON object containing updated configuration options

This method allows you dynamically update existing configuration options. It returns the current JSONPath instance.

_Example:_

    var path = $.JSONPath({keepHistory: false})

    /* ... do some stuff ... */

    path.options({keepHistory: true})


### $.JSONPath(options).query(expression)

* `expression` JSONPath expression to query the data set

This method allows you directly query a JSON dataset. For more information on the actual querying syntax, please visit [Stefen Goessner's website](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). Will return an array containing all matched node values (or paths) or `false` if no matches were found.

_Example:_

    var json = {
      "store": {
        "book": [
          { "category": "reference",
            "author": "Nigel Rees",
            "title": "Sayings of the Century",
            "price": 8.95
          },
          { "category": "fiction",
            "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
            "title": "Sword of Honour",
            "price": 12.99
          },
          { "category": "fiction",
            "author": "Herman Melville",
            "title": "Moby Dick",
            "isbn": "0-553-21311-3",
            "price": 8.99
          },
          { "category": "fiction",
            "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
            "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
            "isbn": "0-395-19395-8",
            "price": 22.99
          }
        ],
        "bicycle": {
          "color": "red",
          "price": 19.95
        }
      }
    }

    var path = $.JSONPath({data: json})

    results = path.query('$.store.book[*].author') // returns all authors

## Usage

    var path = $.JSONPath({
      data: {},
      resultType: 'VALUE',
      keepHistory: true,
      onFound: function(path, value) {},
      onNormalize: function(expression) {},
      onTrace: function(expression, value, path) {},
      onWalk: function(loc, expression, value, path, function) {},
    })

    results = path.query('$.store.book[*].author')

Again, 99% of the credit goes to the guy who actually wrote the original library, Stefen Goessner.
